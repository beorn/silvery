[^1]: Silvery tracks 7 independent dirty flags per node (`contentDirty`, `layoutDirty`, `paintDirty`, `subtreeDirty`, `childrenDirty`, `childPositionChanged`, `hasPrevBuffer`), enabling style-only changes to skip layout and content changes to skip paint.

[^2]: With ~15-50 unique styles per TUI, Silvery caches all (oldStyle, newStyle) SGR transition strings (~2,500 possible pairs), eliminating per-cell string building.

[^3]: Ink has a PR exploring synchronized updates (#846) but it is not yet merged.

[^6]: Silvery's Flexily layout engine is pure JavaScript (7 KB gzipped) with zero native dependencies. It matches Yoga WASM performance and is 2.4x faster than Yoga NAPI. Layout results are cached via fingerprinting, so unchanged subtrees skip recomputation entirely.

[^7]: Silvery's core innovation: two-phase rendering runs layout before components render, so `useContentRect()` returns actual dimensions synchronously during render, not via a post-render callback. This eliminates an entire category of bugs around "width is 0 on first render."

[^8]: Silvery's `createRenderer` provides auto-refreshing locators (same locator object always queries fresh tree state), `getByTestId`/`getByText`/CSS attribute selectors, bounding box assertions, and Playwright-style `press()` input. Locators never go stale.

[^9]: The driver pattern composes `withCommands` + `withKeybindings` + `withDiagnostics` to expose all commands as callable functions with metadata (ID, name, help, keybindings). An AI agent can list available commands, inspect screen state, execute actions, and capture screenshots -- all programmatically.

[^10]: Ink uses Yoga WASM, whose linear memory grows monotonically and cannot shrink without a module reset. This has caused [120+ GB memory usage](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/4953) in long-running production apps (e.g., Claude Code).

## Unique Strengths

> Performance claims below are summary figures. See [benchmarks.md](../../silvery-internal/benchmarks.md) for full benchmark data and [performance.md](deep-dives/performance.md) for optimization details.

### Silvery

- **Two-phase rendering with layout feedback**: Components know their dimensions during render via `useContentRect()` -- the only React-based TUI framework where this works synchronously.
- **Per-node dirty tracking**: Interactive updates (keystroke, scroll) take ~169 us for 1000 nodes vs Ink's 20.7 ms full re-render -- 100x+ faster for the updates that matter.
- **Driver pattern for AI automation**: Composable plugins (`withCommands` + `withKeybindings` + `withDiagnostics`) expose the full command surface for programmatic control, introspection, and testing.

### Ink

- **Largest ecosystem**: ~1.3M npm weekly downloads, 50+ community components (prompts, spinners, tables, select inputs), used by Gatsby, Prisma, Terraform CDK, Shopify CLI.
- **Familiar React model**: Lowest learning curve for React developers -- standard hooks, JSX, and component patterns.
- **Battle-tested stability**: 8+ years of production use across thousands of CLI tools.

### BubbleTea

- **Elm architecture in Go**: Clean Model-Update-View pattern with immutable state. Easy to reason about, easy to test.
- **Rich component ecosystem**: 100+ community "Bubbles" (tables, file pickers, progress bars, viewports, markdown renderers).
- **Single binary deployment**: Go compiles to a static binary -- no runtime dependencies, no package manager.

### Textual

- **CSS theming**: Full CSS files with selectors, variables, and live reload. The closest any TUI framework gets to web-style styling.
- **Web-based DevTools**: A DOM mirror inspector running in the browser, with widget tree exploration, CSS debugging, and live editing.
- **Textual-web**: Serve any Textual app as a web application with no code changes.

### Notcurses

- **Best image rendering**: Native Sixel and Kitty graphics protocol support with per-pixel rendering. The gold standard for terminal graphics.
- **ncplane compositing**: Layered rendering planes with independent z-ordering, scrolling, and damage tracking. Arbitrary overlapping regions without manual clipping.
- **Performance ceiling**: C implementation with zero-copy rendering paths. Handles the highest throughput workloads (media players, data visualizers).

### FTXUI

- **Zero dependencies**: Pure C++17 with no external libraries. Single header inclusion for simple projects.
- **Immediate mode simplicity**: UI is a pure function of state -- no retained tree, no lifecycle management, no stale state bugs.
- **Cross-platform C++**: Works on Linux, macOS, Windows, and WebAssembly (Emscripten) from the same codebase.

### blessed (legacy)

- **Historical significance**: The original comprehensive Node.js TUI framework (2013). Inspired Ink's creation and influenced the terminal UI ecosystem.
- **Widget completeness**: The most complete built-in widget set of any Node.js TUI library (lists, forms, tables, file managers, terminals-in-terminals). No other Node.js framework matched its breadth.
- **Note**: Unmaintained since ~2017. `neo-blessed` is a community fork with minor fixes but no active development. Listed here for historical context.
